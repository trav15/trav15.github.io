Bootstrap has been a powerful tool to help make responsive web pages quickly and easily. One of the cool things about Bootstap's ***12 column grid system*** is that it gives us an easy way to divide up a row of columns in a few different ways. That's because the number 12 is such a cool number. 12 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, and 6 easily and that gives us a good way to divide up our colums.

This is what you would visualize when writing out your col-# in your class names and you can see just how good a number 12 is to divide up evenly. And while going through the lessons I noticed how 8 and 4 are related in a 12 grid system giving you the values for 1/3 and 2/3 of the division.

```
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">col-sm</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">col-sm</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">col-sm</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">col-sm-8</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">col-sm-4</div>
</div>
```

So don't underestimate the power of the number 12 when using Bootstrap or any other responsive css that may come along. After all there are 12 hours in each half day, 12 months in a year, and 12 zodiac signs, among many other notable [twelves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_(number).
