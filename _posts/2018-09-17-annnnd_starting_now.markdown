I guess some background first: I've always had an interest in coding but never jumped the chasm from simple to complex, theory to real life, hand-holding to coding from scratch. I've taken classes in C++, JAVA, Ruby on Rails, and some Swift but never made the time or commitment to get great at it. And so here I am starting again, ready to commit to this (and Git, hehe) and launch myself into getting real professional experience.

For the past few years I've been cooking in a restaurant. Working as a cook is different than cooking at home for so many reasons. In a restaurant kitchen there are pressures you might not have at home like time, quality, and consistency. And of course the volume. In a busy kitchen on a busy night you can feel like you're drowning, barely keeping your head above water. While that might not sound like something you would want to do it can also be something rewarding when you've completed a service. Each day is a chance to learn and get better. Each dish is an instance that can be improved. 

When I mentioned I was a cook to Nancy in the new student orientation she brought up the parallels of cooking to programming. Programs or methods are like recipes where one follows instructions. Ingredients can be data with functions preparing or cooking the ingredients and passing them on to the next step or station. Abstracted further a cook can be a program, whom you teach a specific set of steps to prep for and cook a dish. The better and more specific the instructions, the more consistent the end product.

There are many ways to cook the same dish and I liken that to the many ways you can code a solution. Some solutions are more elegant and robust while others are less efficient. You can optimize by refining instructions/refactoring code. And so just like in cooking I hope to get better every day. I want to learn more and more about coding and continue to gain the tools and experience to be able to solve any problem that comes my way. I want to use the same drive, discipline, and creativity I've developed in the kitchen to give me the same skills in web development.
