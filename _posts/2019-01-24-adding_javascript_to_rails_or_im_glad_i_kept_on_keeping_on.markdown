For the 4th project in my Web Developer bootcamp the assignment was add a Javascript front-end to my previous Rails project (my 3rd project in the bootmcamp). This proved to be a little confusing so if you're past your Rails project and curious about what the next project looks like this may help.

One of the biggest help to solidify my understanding of Javascript + Rails and APIs was this video of a recorded office hours from the then section lead, I assume, [Cernan B](https://github.com/cernanb):

In this video Cernan walks through adding a JS frontend and building your own internal API. The simplicity in the coding and explanation was truly elegant for me and cleared a lot of things up. In contrast, the material from the course (Building APIs section in particular) was kind of disjointed and frustrating, especially with oustanding [issues](https://github.com/learn-co-students/diy-json-serializer-lab-v-000/issues) with the [code-alongs](https://github.com/learn-co-students/returning-string-data-v-000/issues/206) and labs. By the end of the section I really hated these gifs:

It didn't help once I was building my project out to meet the requirements I was referencing this material again in a frustrated mood only to be met with looping taunts ðŸ˜«

But i digress, after much google-fu and trial and error, I began to understand just how the new material on JS could work with my Rails project.
