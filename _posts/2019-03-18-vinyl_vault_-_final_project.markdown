For my Final Project I chose to buid a CMS to keep track of a vinyl record collection. Users can add records with information such as artist, album title, cover image, and any notes (such as condition or where purchased). The project was a culmination of everything I've learned on this journey but focused on using React/Redux as a front-end framework and Ruby on Rails as an API server on the back end. 

I have to admit this project did push my learning and forced me to see where my understanding of the material wasn't as strong. I definitely had to spend many hours with my Google-Fu trying to work out problems that where coming up as I was building this out.
