Learning how to use the generate command to easliy generate most of what you need (and some of what you don't) quick and easily. 

```

$ bin/rails generate controller
Usage: rails generate controller NAME [action action] [options]
 
...
...
 
Description:
    ...
 
    To create a controller within a module, specify the controller name as a path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.
 
    ...
 
Example:
    `rails generate controller CreditCards open debit credit close`
 
    Credit card controller with URLs like /credit_cards/debit.
        Controller: app/controllers/credit_cards_controller.rb
        Test:       test/controllers/credit_cards_controller_test.rb
        Views:      app/views/credit_cards/debit.html.erb [...]
        Helper:     app/helpers/credit_cards_helper.rb
```
